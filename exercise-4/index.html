      <h1>Exercise 4: Evaluating Learnability of a Vector Graphics Editor</h1>

        <h2>Tool Used</h2>
        <p>
          For this exercise, I evaluated Figma. When I first opened Figma, the
          interface appeared clean and modern, but also overwhelming. While the
          layout suggested professional capabilities, it lacked clear onboarding
          guidance for first-time users.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>

          <figcaption>Design Panel</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Layer_Panel.png" alt="Layer Panel" />
          <figcaption>Layer Panel</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Several aspects of Figma were not immediately learnable and required
          outside help. One major challenge was understanding the differences
          between frames, groups, and components, as their purposes were not
          immediately apparent. I also struggled with basic tasks such as
          resizing objects proportionally, aligning elements precisely, and
          understanding how layers interacted with each other.

          Another feature that was not obvious was the ability to convert text
          to vector outlines. I had to search online to learn that this action
          is called “Outline stroke” in Figma and that it permanently converts
          text into shapes. Exporting files as SVG rather than raster formats
          also required additional research.

        <h2>Time on Task</h2>
        <p>
          It took approximately 150 minutes to complete the business card,
          letterhead, and envelope designs. A considerable portion of this time
          was spent learning how to use the interface, locating tools, and
          correcting mistakes rather than designing.

        <h2>Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          While Figma is a powerful and flexible tool, it could be more
          learnable for beginners. The application would benefit from clearer
          visual signals, contextual tooltips, and a guided tutorial that walks
          new users through common tasks such as creating frames, aligning
          elements, and exporting vector files.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Comparison to Other Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Prior to this assignment, I had experience using simpler design tools
          such as Canva. Compared to Canva, Figma offers significantly more
          control and precision but is less forgiving for beginners. Tasks that
          are automated or simplified in Canva required manual setup and
          technical understanding in Figma.
