      <h2>Good Contrast(A)</h2>

      </figure>
      <p>
        This flyer follows the principle of contrast by using bright neon text
        and graphics against a dark background, making key information highly
        visible and attention-grabbing.

      <h2>Violates Contrast(A)</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="Contrast-Violates.png" alt="Cady's Candy" />
      </figure>
      <h4>Explanation:</h4>
      <p>
        This design violates the principle of contrast because many text
        elements are placed over bright, busy backgrounds using colors that are
        too similar in brightness and saturation, making the text difficult to
        read.
      </p>
      <h4>How to improve:</h4>
      <p>
        Contrast could be improved by using darker text on light backgrounds ,
        adding solid color overlays behind text, and limiting the color palette
        for typography so important messages stand out clearly.

      <h2>Good Proximity(B)</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="Proximity-Good.png" alt="flowers flyer" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        This flyer partially follows the principle of proximity by grouping
        related information such as services offered and business hours close
        together. However, proximity could be improved by clearly separating
        sections like contact information, services

      <h2>Violates Proximity(B)</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="Proximity-Violates.png" alt="Hamfest flyer" />
      </figure>
      <h4>Explanation:</h4>
      <p>
        This poster violates proximity because related information such as date,
        time, location, and activities are scattered across the layout instead
        of being grouped together.
      </p>

      <h4>How to improve:</h4>
      <p>
        Grouping related details into clear sections (event info, activities,
        location) and increasing spacing between unrelated elements would make
        the poster easier to scan and understand
