      <h2>Exercise 1: Typography Improvements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I replaced the unstructured layout with elements such as header, nav,
          main, section, and footer to improve document structure and
          readability.
        </li>
        <li>
          I improved typographic hierarchy by organizing content into clear
          sections using consistent heading levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          I increased text readability by applying a consistent line height and
          limiting the width of the main content area.
        </li>
